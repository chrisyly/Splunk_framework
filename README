Splunk test framework
========================

Summary:
The Splunk test framwork is built for Splunk homsimple.sqliteework
The major purpose is to test the Splunk REST API

Tasks:
1. Test Splunk REST API end point
  a. GET request
  b. POST request

Automation:
The Splunk test framework should handle (automate) the following tasks:
1. Test environment set up:
  a. automate the process add/remove DUTs (device under test)
  b. automate the process pre-configure the test environment, test execution, and post processing test logs, generating a final log
  c. automate the process monitering the DUTs during the tests
2. API for test REST API:
  a. utility tools for handling REST API response data
    1. validating the data
	2. math lib:
	  a. sort
	  b. search
	  c. calcute sum
	3. report parser
  b. OPTIONAL: deploy the framework on remote cloud server

======================== How to run =======================
The current SAuto is implemented with Perl v5.26.1, earlier packages is not tested

OS environment:
Linux system, (Ubuntu 14.04 and above recommended)

To install the dependency:
sudo cpan install <package_name>

List of Perl dependency:
1.DateTime
2.JSON
3.REST::Client

Splunk Movie tests scripts are under:
<git_root_folder>/splunk_framework/scripts/splunk

Splunk Movie libs are under:
<git_root_folder>/splunk_framework/lib/Splunk

steps:
1. give the proper authority to splunk_framework/scripts/splunk scripts
2. cd <git_root_folder>/splunk_framework/scripts/splunk; ./test_plan.sh

======================== Known bugs from Splunk Movie API =========================
1. GET request will always return 'batman' result (return code: 200) no matter other strings being put in the query
2. GET request will always ignore the <count> query (return code: 200) no matter what value is put in the query
3. SPL_001 failed, movie has the same image in database
4. SPL_002 failed, invalid non-null image url is detected
5. SPL_003 failed, the movie in database is not correctly sorted according to the RULE

6. POST request will always return code: 200. No matter what payload (name and description) is inputed
7. POST request will not add the movie to the database. (Varified by running GET right after POST)
8. because (7) failed, none of the SPL tests are valid to test POST request

======================== About SAuto Framework ==========================
SAuto is an automation framework developed for remote devices deploy
and control.

Devices with SAuto framework installed having the following features: (Under development)
1. Devices are discoveriable and configurable through local/internet/serial/etc... network
2. Any node (devices) can preform as controller/clients and recurit any available
clients with requirements throught network
3. Each node provide a cloud services to discover and maintain the discovery network - a minimum at least one routing server is required
4. A could server is providing and responsible for uploading and downloading user defined lib/packages/etc...

TODO list:
*. install script to download and install the framework
1. discovery process
2. infurstructure
3. CI process for integrating libs/packages
4. upper/lower communication port/protocal for more devices supports
===================================================================

Planning:
TODO: automation controller setup
TODO: OPTIONAL - DUTs set up (PCs, phones, tablets, etc...)
TODO: develop API for testing REST API
TODO: deploy the framework on cloud
